spoiler: "What I'm using for software development in 2026"
---

This is my current setup for software development in 2026.
I have been using this setup for a while now and I am pretty happy with it.

## Hardware

### Macbook

I'm using a Macbook Pro 16", M4 chip with 48 GB of RAM.
This is pretty much an overkill laptop for the type of work I do,
which is mainly frontend development) but hey,
I can't complain on my work computer 👨🏽‍🔬.

I'm using an external monitor, both at work and at home.
A 27" 2k montior both at work and at home, which is pretty good for my needs,
Although I would love to try a 32" 4k monitor at some point, _I think writing code
in 4k makes you a better software engineer._ (jk)
I used to have 2 27" monitors setup but I found that I'm
not really using the second monitor that much,
and the head movement was a bit annoying,
so I decided to go back to a single monitor setup.

### Keyboard

So that's the part that mostly changed in the last few years,
I switched from an Apple Magic Keyboard, to Logitech MX Keys, to Logitech MX Mechanical,
to a custom 65% mechanical keyboard with Gateron Brown switches to Nuphy Air 75.
But then, I entered the rabbit hole of split keyboards, which is a creepy new world.
My first try was straight on building one - the [Totem](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM),
This one was a fun project, considering the fact that
I never touched a soldering iron before,
it was a bit too much, and I ended up burning the one of the 2 batteries
I ordered from AliExpress, which meant I needed to order more,
and wait another 40 days for batteries.
So I eventually gave in and pulled the trigger on the one board that
caught my eyes all over
youtube, and [r/ErgoMechKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/)
which is the glory [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager)

This is an awesome keyboard, but this was (and still is) one hell of a ride.
Jumping from a regular layout to a split layout is really a pain in the ass.
I think it took me about a month to get to like 40wpm. I wasn't a fast typer before,
and I tried learning touch typing on a regular keyboard,
but I guess 20 years of bad behaviors are hard to change.
Jumping to this new layout forced me to change, forced me to use the correct
fingers on its correlated touch typing char. Now it's pretty fun typing
on the Voyager, won't lie, I'm still getting funny looks from co-workers but
fuck it.

I eventually changed my switches to [Ambient Silent Choc Switches](https://holykeebs.com/products/ambients-silent-choc-switches),
I bought 10 Nocturnal (20gf) and about 40 Twilight (35gf), just because
I wanted to have a smoother typing experience,
(and quieter in the office). Definitely an improvement
from the Choc Pro Reds you get with the stock one, which are bad imo.

I also bought the Shhhocs, which dampen the sound even more, because
they force the keycap to not hit the board.

All in all, great experience but not a cheap one
(which made me wanting to not give up!) but I definitely
won't recommend anyone this kind of adventure.

## software

### Ghostty

Been using ghostty for about a year now, great terminal emulator overall.
I like the customizability, but the tab bar looks bad lol.

### neovim

So for the past 2 years I've been using nvim for my IDE.
I had some weeks where I moved to cursor, spend too much time
configuring its vim motions, then eventually got tired from using it.
Something about being inside the terminal, always, just clicks for me.

I must say that I do use VSCode for its magnificent github extension,
which I use to review, and resolve comments on PR's.
Haven't found an equivalent plugin for neovim yet.

I'm using Lazyvim because its pretty much plug n' play.
My dotfiles are published [here](https://github.com/shaked-frame/dotfiles)
if you want to check them out.

### AI

So, ai has become a huge part of my daily job, and development flow.
I tried almost everything to this point I think. I stuck with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/)
which I'm using with either my Copilot subscription or ChatGPT subscription.
I either use it straight via CLI, or through
[Sidekick.nvim](https://github.com/folke/sidekick.nvim) which is pretty great

### Raycast

I don't think I need to say anything about raycast, it's the missing piece on every
Macbook, and not Windows pc's too.

I think that's it, those are the main ones, honestly. I have some cool stuff
in my .zshrc, that I might write about later but, yeah pretty simple.
I wonder what will change in the upcoming year. I do want to get better using vim, that's for sure.
